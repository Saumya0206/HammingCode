Implemented Hamming Code Error Detection Scheme using Dataflow modelling under Dr. Nitin Bhatia

# Overview
Hamming code is a block code that is capable of detecting up to two simultaneous bit errors and correcting single-bit errors. It was developed by R.W. Hamming for error correction. <br/>
Hamming codes are a class of binary linear codes. It is executed by encoding the original message with a series of redundant bits in positions of the powers of two and the number of occurrences of these extra bits is determined according to an inequality. This specific positioning makes it possible to detect and correct the errors of transmission i.e the receivers of the message can perform recalculations to detect errors and find the bit position of the erroneous bit if it exists. Here, redundant bits are called as parity bits.
